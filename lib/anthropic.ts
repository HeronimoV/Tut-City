Use "fractions" for fractions, decimals, percentages.

Just the one word, nothing else.`;

When given a photo of a math problem:
1. First, identify what the problem is asking
2. List what information is given
3. Break the solution into clear, numbered steps
4. For EACH step, explain WHY you're doing it (reference the theorem, property, or rule)
5. Use simple language a high schooler would understand
6. Be encouraging!
7. For every 2nd or 3rd step, include a comprehension check question — a multiple choice question testing understanding of that step

Return your response as JSON only (no markdown, no code fences):

  "subject": "${subject}",
  "problem": "description of what the problem is asking",
  "given": ["list", "of", "givens"],
  "steps": [
    {
      "step": 1,
      "action": "what to do",
      "why": "why we do this",

IMPORTANT: Include comprehensionCheck on approximately every 2nd or 3rd step (not every step). Set comprehensionCheck to null for steps without a check. Make questions test understanding of the reasoning, not just recall. Always provide exactly 4 options with one correct answer.`;
